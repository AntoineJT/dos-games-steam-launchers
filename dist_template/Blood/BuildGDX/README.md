# Installation

First, check the section above: you need to build the file yourself.

Since this is a BloodGDX launcher, you'll need `java.exe` to be in the PATH of your system. \
You can download the closed source official [Oracle JRE](https://www.java.com/download/) or the open source OpenJDK prebuilt binaries by [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

Download BuildGDX on [the official website](https://m210.duke4.net/), and put it in your Steam Blood directory.
It must be named `BuildGDX.jar`. \
Rename the original `dosbox.exe` file to whatever you want, for example, `dosbox.exe.orig`. \
Copy the previously compiled `dosbox_bloodgdx.exe` to your Blood Steam folder and rename it `dosbox.exe`.

You can now run the game using the Steam Play button.
