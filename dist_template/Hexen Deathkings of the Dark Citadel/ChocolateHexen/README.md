# Installation

For every `dosbox_<something>.exe` file, just rename it `dosbox.exe` to replace the original `dosbox.exe` file (rename the original one to `dosbox.orig.exe` to be able to revert the process without verifying file integrity in Steam).

For the 3 heretic/hexen games supported, the original dosbox.exe file to replace can be found in the `base/` subfolder in the game files.
